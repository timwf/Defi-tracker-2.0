### Current Metrics

## 2. APY Analysis âœ… GREEN

### Current Rates

| Rate Type | Current | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **PT Implied APY** | **15.09%** | âœ… Above purchase (14.94%) |
| **sUSDai Underlying APY** | 8.72% | Stable |
| **Base Pool APY** | 12.25% | Healthy |

### Implied APY Trend

```
Nov 17: 17.86% (high incentives phase)
Nov 24: 16.22% 
Dec 1:  15.90%
Dec 8:  15.09% âœ… (current)
```

**Change:** -2.77% over 24 days

**Analysis:** The decline is expected and healthy. Early PT markets typically start with higher implied yields due to uncertainty, then compress as maturity approaches and more data validates the underlying protocol. Your locked rate (15.09%) remains above the purchase expectation (14.94%).

### Underlying sUSDai APY Trend (Weekly 7-day MA)

```
Nov 10: 3.4%  (protocol launch, ramping up)
Nov 17: 10.6% (rapid growth)
Nov 24: 9.2%
Dec 1:  8.8%
Dec 8:  8.7%  âœ… (stable)
```

**Status:** Stabilized around 8-9% âœ…

**Analysis:** The underlying sUSDai yield has found a sustainable range after initial volatility. This is positiveâ€”volatile underlying yields would make your PT position riskier. The 7-day moving average (8.7%) provides a solid base yield for the protocol.

## 3. Market Liquidity Analysis âœ… GREEN

### TVL Growth (Pendle PT-sUSDai Market)

| Period | TVL | Change |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Nov 17 (start) | $134,510 | Baseline |
| Dec 4 | $74.7M | +55,400% |
| Dec 11 | **$85.2M** | **+14% (7d)** |

**Total growth:** From $134k to $85M in 24 days = **63,232% growth** ðŸš€

**Analysis:** Explosive TVL growth signals strong market confidence. The market went from minimal liquidity to $85M in under a month. Your $2k position now represents only 0.002% of market TVLâ€”plenty of liquidity for exit if needed.

### Trading Volume

| Period | Volume |
|--------|--------|
| Last 24 hours | $4.08M |
| Last 7 days | $34.5M |
| Daily average | $4.9M |

**Largest hourly trade:** $3.7M (Dec 8)

**Analysis:** Daily volume averaging $5M with your position at $2k means you could exit with minimal slippage (<0.5%). The market is actively traded with consistent volume.

### Liquidity Assessment

**Can you exit your $2k position?**
- Your position: $1,998
- Typical hourly volume: $200k-500k
- Your position as % of hourly volume: **0.4-1%**
- **Expected slippage on full exit:** <0.5% âœ…

**Verdict:** Excellent liquidity. You could exit in single trade with minimal impact.

## 4. Protocol Health (USD.AI) âš ï¸ YELLOW

### Available Data

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Market cap | $501M | Coinbase (Dec 11) |
| Last confirmed TVL | $500M deposits | September 2025 |
| Pendle market TVL | $85.2M | Live data |
| Protocol status | Active | No incidents |

### Recent Events (Positive)

âœ… **Coinbase Ventures investment** (Nov 17)  
âœ… **AutoVaults sunset completed** (Nov 24) - moved to organic growth  
âœ… **Balancer exploit avoided** (Nov 3) - USD.AI pools unaffected  
âœ… **Compute Labs borrower payment** confirmed (first borrower paying)  
âœ… **sUSDai trending #3** in yield-bearing tokens (Stablewatch)  

### Data Gap

âš ï¸ **Unable to verify current USD.AI total protocol TVL** (DeFiLlama page blocked)

**Last known:** $500M deposits (September 2025)  
**Current market cap:** $501M (suggests TVL stable or growing)  
**Pendle market:** $85.2M TVL (subset of total, growing +14% weekly)

**Assessment:** All available signals are positive. The inability to verify exact TVL is a documentation gap, not a red flag. No negative events or community concerns detected.

## 5. Risk Monitoring âœ… ALL GREEN

### Exit Trigger Status

| Trigger | Threshold | Current | Status |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| PT discount | >7% | 2.64% | âœ… Healthy |
| Implied APY collapse | <12% | 15.09% | âœ… Strong |
| TVL crash | >-30% in 30d | +14% (7d) | âœ… Growing |
| USD.AI incident | Any | None | âœ… Clear |
| Borrower default | Major | None | âœ… Clear |
| Liquidity crisis | <$1M daily vol | $4M | âœ… Excellent |

**Result:** Zero exit triggers active.

### Risk Score: 2/10 (Very Low)

**Breakdown:**
- Price risk: 1/10 (PT at expected discount, smooth convergence)
- Liquidity risk: 1/10 (excellent volume, can exit easily)
- Protocol risk: 3/10 (young protocol, but strong backing and no issues)
- Market risk: 2/10 (maturity in 69 days, locked rate)

**Primary risk:** USD.AI protocol failure before Feb 19 maturity. Mitigated by: strong institutional backing (Coinbase Ventures, Framework, Dragonfly), first borrower payment confirmed, $85M Pendle TVL as validation.
