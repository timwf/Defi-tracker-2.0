## wstETH (Lido Wrapped Staked ETH)

**URL:** https://lido.fi  
**Type:** Liquid staking  
**APY:** 3.5% (from Ethereum staking rewards)  
**Risk:** Low (largest liquid staking protocol, $30B+ TVL)  
**Target allocation:** 30%

### Acquire wstETH

**Method 1: Buy ETH on Kraken, Swap on Arbitrum (Recommended)**

1. Buy ETH on Kraken (see on-ramp section)
2. Withdraw ETH to Arbitrum wallet
3. Go to https://app.lido.fi
4. Connect MetaMask
5. Select Arbitrum network
6. Click "Wrap" (if coming from regular stETH)
7. Or use Uniswap/other DEX to swap ETH â†’ wstETH directly
8. Enter ETH amount
9. Approve and confirm swap (~$0.10-0.50 gas)
10. wstETH appears in wallet

**Method 2: Swap on Aave (Alternative)**

1. Have ETH in wallet on Arbitrum
2. Go to app.aave.com
3. Find ETH in assets
4. Click "Wrap to wstETH" toggle
5. Enter ETH amount
6. Confirm transactions
7. wstETH appears in wallet

**Gas cost:** ~$0.10-0.50 depending on method

### Hold wstETH

**Recommended strategy:** Just hold in wallet

- Earns 3.5% APY automatically through price appreciation
- wstETH price increases, balance stays same
- Check value on lido.fi or DeBank
- **Do NOT supply to lending protocols** (0.33% APY not worth it)

**Why not lend wstETH:**
- Aave wstETH lending: Only 0.33% APY
- Complexity not worth minimal yield
- Simpler to just hold
- Still earning 3.5% staking rewards

### Convert wstETH to USDC (when needed)

1. Go to Uniswap on Arbitrum or use DEX aggregator
2. Select wstETH â†’ USDC
3. Enter amount
4. Accept 0.05-0.2% slippage
5. Confirm swap (~$0.20-0.50 gas)
6. USDC in wallet

**Gas cost:** ~$0.20-0.50

### Notes

- Growth component of portfolio (30% allocation)
- Earns Ethereum staking rewards passively
- Price fluctuates with ETH market (accepted volatility)
- Liquid (can sell anytime)
- Simplest to just hold in wallet and let it earn
- Value increases automatically through price appreciation

## General Procedures

### Network Verification (CRITICAL)

**Before EVERY transaction:**

1. Check MetaMask shows "Arbitrum One"
2. Verify Chain ID: 42161
3. Check RPC URL: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
4. If wrong network: 
   - Click network dropdown in MetaMask
   - Select "Arbitrum One"
   - Verify before proceeding

**âš ï¸ WRONG NETWORK = PERMANENTLY LOST FUNDS**

**Common mistakes:**
- Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1) âŒ
- Optimism (Chain ID: 10) âŒ
- Polygon (Chain ID: 137) âŒ
- Base (Chain ID: 8453) âŒ
- **Arbitrum One (Chain ID: 42161) âœ“**

### Transaction Approval Pattern

Most protocols require two transactions:

1. **Approve (First time only):** 
   - Give protocol permission to access your tokens
   - Cost: ~$0.01-0.02 gas
   - Only needed once per protocol per token

2. **Execute:** 
   - Actually deposit/withdraw tokens
   - Cost: ~$0.02-0.05 gas
   - Needed for every transaction

**This is normal security design. Never skip approval.**

### Gas Fee Expectations

**Arbitrum typical costs:**
- Token approval: $0.01-0.02
- Supply/Deposit: $0.02-0.05
- Withdraw: $0.02-0.05
- Swap (DEX): $0.10-0.50

**Red flags:**
- Gas fee >$1.00 on Arbitrum â†’ Something wrong, check network
- Gas fee >$10.00 â†’ Definitely wrong network (probably Ethereum mainnet)

**Gas spike handling:**
- Arbitrum gas rarely matters (always cheap)
- If unusually high: Wait 10-15 minutes and retry
- Never pay >$0.50 for simple supply/withdraw on Arbitrum

### Verification After Transaction

**Standard verification process:**

1. Click transaction notification in MetaMask
2. Click "View on Arbiscan"
3. Verify status: "Success" (green checkmark)
4. Check destination: Protocol contract address
5. Verify amount transferred correctly
6. Open protocol dashboard
7. Confirm position shows correct amount
8. Check DeBank app for updated portfolio value
9. Take screenshot for records
10. Update tracking spreadsheet

**Transaction failed troubleshooting:**
- Check ETH balance for gas (need >Â£30-50)
- Verify correct network selected
- Try increasing gas limit slightly
- Check protocol Discord for known issues

### Emergency Procedures

**Transaction pending forever:**
- Usually resolves in 1-2 minutes
- If >10 minutes: Try "Speed Up" in MetaMask
- If >30 minutes: Check Arbiscan for tx status
- Arbitrum rarely has this issue

**Can't withdraw:**
- Check protocol dashboard for maintenance
- Verify sufficient balance in position
- For Morpho: Check for withdrawal queue (rare)
- Try smaller amount if full balance fails
- Check Discord for protocol status

**Wallet compromised:**
- **Immediately withdraw all funds to Wallet 2**
- Use desktop if mobile compromised (or vice versa)
- Create new Wallet 1 with entirely new seed phrase
- Never reuse compromised wallet
- Review how compromise occurred (phishing link, malware, etc.)

## Protocol Selection Priority

### Primary Use Cases

**Aave (23.3%):**
- Monthly Â£1,500 deposits â†’ Always goes here first
- Most liquid for emergency access
- Most conservative/safest option
- 3-5% APY range

**Morpho (23.3%):**
- Enhanced yield (5-8% APY)
- Quarterly rebalancing destination
- Institutional curator oversight
- Good risk/reward balance

**Fluid (23.3%):**
- Highest stable yield (6-8% APY)
- Monthly monitoring required
- Test small before scaling
- Be prepared to exit if issues

**wstETH (30%):**
- Growth component
- Just hold in wallet
- 3.5% APY + price appreciation
- Liquid but plan to hold long-term

### Decision Tree

**For monthly Â£1,500 deposit:**
â†’ Always Aave (simplifies workflow)

**For rebalancing:**
â†’ Check allocation drift â†’ Move from overweight to underweight

**For new capital (>Â£1,500):**
â†’ Follow target allocation (equal splits for stablecoins, 30% wstETH)

**If protocol has issue:**
â†’ Pause deposits â†’ Assess â†’ Withdraw if severe â†’ Redistribute to remaining protocols

## Common Errors & Solutions

### "Insufficient funds for gas"
**Problem:** Not enough ETH in wallet  
**Solution:** Keep Â£30-50 ETH in Wallet 1, Â£20-30 in Wallet 2  
**Prevention:** Check ETH balance before starting transactions

### "Transaction will revert"
**Problem:** Protocol limits reached or liquidity issue  
**Solution:** Reduce amount by 1-2% and retry  
**Note:** Rare on Arbitrum, usually resolves quickly

### "Wrong network"
**Problem:** Not on Arbitrum One  
**Solution:** Click network dropdown â†’ Select Arbitrum One  
**Prevention:** ALWAYS verify before every transaction

### "Approval required"
**Problem:** First time using protocol needs token approval  
**Solution:** Click "Approve" first (~$0.01), then supply/deposit  
**Note:** This is normal, required once per protocol per token

### "Slippage too high"
**Problem:** Price movement during swap  
**Solution:** Accept higher slippage (0.5-1%) or try smaller amount  
**Note:** Usually only happens on wstETH swaps, not USDC deposits

### "Kraken withdrawal pending"
**Problem:** Waiting for blockchain confirmation  
**Solution:** Wait 5-15 minutes, check Arbiscan with wallet address  
**Prevention:** Normal, nothing to prevent

### "MetaMask stuck on pending"
**Problem:** Transaction not confirming  
**Solution:** Click transaction â†’ "Speed Up" â†’ Increase gas  
**Note:** Rare on Arbitrum, usually resolves in 1-2 minutes

## Security Best Practices

### Seed Phrase Management

**DO:**
- Write on paper only
- Store 3+ copies in separate physical locations
- Verify backups periodically (quarterly)
- Keep locked/hidden

**DON'T:**
- Take photos
- Store digitally (no cloud, no password manager)
- Email or message
- Store all copies in same location

### Transaction Verification

**Before EVERY transaction:**
- Verify network: Arbitrum One (Chain ID: 42161)
- Check recipient address
- Confirm amount correct
- Review gas fee reasonable

**After EVERY transaction:**
- Verify on Arbiscan (green checkmark)
- Confirm position in protocol dashboard
- Check DeBank updated correctly
- Screenshot for records

### Wallet Hygiene

**Do regularly:**
- Review approved contracts (Settings â†’ Security)
- Revoke unused approvals
- Check transaction history for anomalies
- Clear browser cache after sessions

**Do never:**
- Share seed phrase with anyone
- Enter seed phrase in browser
- Connect to unknown/untrusted dApps
- Click random Discord/Twitter links

### Phishing Prevention

**Official URLs only:**
- app.aave.com
- app.morpho.org
- fluid.instadapp.io
- lido.fi

**Red flags:**
- "aave-app.com" (wrong)
- "morpho.io" instead of ".org" (wrong)
- "app-lido.com" (wrong)
- Discord DMs offering "support"
- "Verify your wallet" messages

**Always:**
- Bookmark official sites
