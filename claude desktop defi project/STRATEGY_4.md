## Strategic Shift: L1 Thesis (November 2025)

### The Collapsing L2 Value Proposition

The core reason to use L2s has historically been cost savings. In 2023-2024, gas savings versus mainnet were 50-100x. That arbitrage is disappearing:

| Factor | 2023-2024 | Late 2025 | Implication |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| L1 gas price | 30-70+ gwei | 0.085-2.7 gwei | 95%+ reduction |
| Gas savings vs mainnet | 50-100x | 2-5x | Marginal advantage |
| Sequencer risk | "Worth it for savings" | Harder to justify | Risk/reward inverted |
| Bridge risk | "Worth it for savings" | Harder to justify | Risk/reward inverted |
| Complexity | "Worth it for savings" | Harder to justify | Risk/reward inverted |

**Key insight:** When L1 transactions cost $0.39 instead of $86, the entire L2 value proposition shifts from "necessary cost savings" to "nice to have convenience." The risks (sequencer centralisation, bridge exploits, complexity) no longer justify the diminishing benefits.

### Fusaka Upgrade (December 3, 2025)

Ethereum's Fusaka hard fork accelerates this thesis:

- **Gas limit increase:** 45M Ã¢â€ â€™ 150M (3.3x capacity)
- **Throughput improvement:** ~15-20 TPS Ã¢â€ â€™ ~40-60 TPS
- **PeerDAS:** More efficient data availability for validators
- **Verkle Trees:** Reduced node requirements

**Impact:** L1 becomes even cheaper and faster. The gap between L1 and L2 costs narrows further.

### Strategic Decision: L1 Primary

**Current state:** Hybrid (L1 primary, Arbitrum legacy)  
**Future state:** Primarily Ethereum L1

**Rationale:**
- Remove sequencer risk (Arbitrum sequencer is centralised)
- Remove bridge risk (no need to bridge back to mainnet)
- Reduce complexity (one primary network)
- Align with macro thesis (L1 resurgence)
- Gas costs now comparable for DeFi operations

### What Could Invalidate This Thesis

- L1 gas spikes return due to NFT/DeFi mania
- L2 exclusive applications become must-have
- Major L2 token airdrops create compelling opportunity cost
- Fusaka upgrade delayed or fails

**Mitigation:** Maintain Arbitrum position (Morpho) as hedge. Strategy is "L1 first" not "L1 only."

## Capital Deployment

### Weekly Deployment Strategy (Updated Nov 28, 2025)

**Previous:** Ã‚Â£8,000/month for 5 months  
**Current:** Ã‚Â£1,500/week until bank buffer reaches Ã‚Â£10k

**Why weekly:**
- Natural rebalancing every week
- Protocol testing with small amounts first
- Lower risk while learning L1 protocols
- Flexibility to adjust pace

**Capital flow:**
- Withdraw Ã‚Â£1,500/week from bank capital
- Continue Ã‚Â£1,500/month savings on top
- Stop deployment when bank = Ã‚Â£10k buffer
- Timeline: ~8-9 months (vs original 5 months)

**On-ramp:** Revolut Ã¢â€ â€™ Kraken Ã¢â€ â€™ Ethereum Mainnet

### Deployment Progress

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total target | Ã‚Â£40,000 |
| Currently deployed | ~Ã‚Â£6,563 |
| Remaining | ~Ã‚Â£33,437 |
| Weekly rate | Ã‚Â£1,500 |
| Expected completion | April-May 2026 |

## Risk Management

### Diversification Framework

**See RISK_FRAMEWORK.md for complete details.**

**Summary:**

| Rule | Current Scale (<Ã‚Â£20k) |
|------|----------------------|
| Max per protocol | 25% of stablecoins |
| Min protocols | 3-4 |
| Anchor minimum | 15% of stablecoins |
| Emerging + Experimental cap | 40% combined |

### Protocol Tiers

| Tier | Failure Estimate | Examples | Max Allocation |
|------|------------------|----------|----------------|
| Anchor | 0.5% | Aave, Compound | Uncapped |
| Established | 2% | Morpho, Euler V2 | 25% each |
| Emerging | 5% | Fluid, Silo | 15% each |
| Experimental | 10% | Case-by-case | 10% each |

### Expected Loss Budget

- **Annual expected loss:** 1.5-2.5% of stablecoins from potential protocol failures
- **15-year expectation:** 1-2 protocol failures, ~10-25% of one year's value
- **Net return:** Gross APY minus expected loss = sustainable returns

### Security Requirements

**Seed phrase management:**
- Paper only (never digital)
- 3+ physical locations per wallet
- Stored separately from each other
- Never photographed or typed

**Transaction verification:**
- Always verify Ethereum Mainnet before transactions
- Double-check recipient addresses
- Bookmark official protocol sites only
- Test small amounts on new protocols

**Wallet structure:**
- Wallet 1 (Operational): 60% Ã¢â‚¬â€ Chrome/Brave
- Wallet 2 (Long-term): 40% Ã¢â‚¬â€ Firefox (different browser)
- Different seed phrases for each

## Rebalancing Rules

### 70/30 Portfolio Split

**Goal:** Maintain 70% stablecoins / 30% wstETH

**Method:** Weekly Ã‚Â£1,500 deposits automatically rebalance to target

**Formula:**
```
Current portfolio: Ã‚Â£T
After deposit: Ã‚Â£(T + 1,500)

To stables: (T + 1,500) Ãƒâ€” 0.70 - [Current Stables]
To wstETH: (T + 1,500) Ãƒâ€” 0.30 - [Current wstETH]
```

**Circuit Breakers:**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| wstETH >55% | Sell wstETH Ã¢â€ â€™ USDC before deposit |
| wstETH <15% | Sell USDC Ã¢â€ â€™ wstETH before deposit |

### Stablecoin Protocol Allocation

**See RISK_FRAMEWORK.md for complete protocol allocation rules.**

**Summary:**
- Maintain scale-based concentration limits
- Prioritize underweight protocols during deposits
- 10% minimum floor per protocol once added
- Use deposits for rebalancing (not selling)

---

## Network Configuration

### Primary: Ethereum L1

- Chain ID: 1
- Explorer: etherscan.io
- Gas token: ETH
- Typical cost: $0.50-3.00 per transaction

### Legacy: Arbitrum One

- Chain ID: 42161
- Explorer: arbiscan.io
- Current position: Morpho Gauntlet
- Status: Holding for diversification

**Network split:** ~75-80% L1, ~20-25% Arbitrum

---

## Prohibited Strategies

**Never:**
- Use leverage or borrowing
- Exceed concentration limits (see Risk Framework)
- Lend wstETH (APY not worth complexity)
- Chase yields >15% (typically unsustainable)
- Skip network verification
- Store seed phrases digitally
- Use protocols without proper audits
- Invest in tokens/coins (stablecoins and ETH only)
- Deploy to L2s (except maintaining existing Arbitrum position)
